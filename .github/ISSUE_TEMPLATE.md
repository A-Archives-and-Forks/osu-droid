# Before you create a issue, you should know
- Main team members can only understand English and Chinese, so please use these 2 languages.
- Do not ask questions about some general topics without any suggestions, otherwise we can't get any extra information because we already know the things you talk about.
- Bug report should be repeatable, and if you get a bug, you should ask for help in discord or qq first, please only issue a new bug.
- An issue with your actual work (such as a pull request that solves your issue) will be helpful, that's most valuable.
- ****DELETE these lines before you create a issue.****
