# Before you create an issue, you should know:
- Main team members can only understand English and Chinese, so please use these 2 languages.
- Do not ask questions about some general topics without any suggestions, otherwise we can't get any extra information, because we already know the things you're talking about.
- Bug reports should be repeatable, and if you get a bug, you should ask for help in the Discord server or QQ first, please only make an issue for new bugs.
- An issue with your actual work (such as a pull request that solves your issue) will be helpful, that's the most valuable.
- ****DELETE these lines before you create a issue.****
