Version 1.8.5
=============

# Additions

- Add back button to gameplay loading screen in singleplayer <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Does the same as the device back button, but more convenient to use.

# Changes

- Prevent screen from dimming during gameplay <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Dimming during gameplay can cause distractions and unexpected behavior (e.g., when watching a replay or a beatmap
    with the Autoplay mod).
- Hide input block areas when watching a replay or using the Autoplay mod <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - The player cannot interact with hitobjects in these modes, so the input block areas are unnecessary.
- Only snake out sliders if the slider head is hit properly <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Technically, this is a bug fix, but it brings the behavior in line with osu!lazer's snaking out sliders setting.
- Fade mods that are incompatible with one or more currently selected mods in mod menu <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Mark Freeze Frame mod as a difficulty adjusting mod for osu!droid star rating <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - The Freeze Frame mod now affects osu!droid star rating and performance points!
- Improve storyboard and video loading speed <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - They may still be loading when gameplay starts, but the loading starts earlier now.
- Replace shrink playfield downwards setting with adjustable horizontal/vertical position <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This gives players a better control over playfield positioning.
  - To replicate the shrink downwards behavior, set horizontal position to 50% and vertical position to 100%.
- Briefly display playfield area when playfield-related settings are changed <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - When changing the size or position of the playfield, a transparent box will be shown briefly to indicate the
    playfield area.
  - This box will not be shown if the playfield size is 100% (since it will cover the entire screen anyway, so the
    position settings do not matter).
- Update music volume directly when changing it in settings <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - No more going back to the main menu to hear the change!
- Play osu! cookie hit sound when sound effect volume is changed <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Allows the player to gauge the loudness of sound effects without having to manually trigger one.
  - The osu! cookie hit sound is chosen specifically since it is not skinnable (which means the player cannot silence it
    via skins).
- Allow player to change settings from settings layout when restarting gameplay <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - To still satisfy players who only want a quick restart, a shorter delay is used instead of the usual one (when
    gameplay is not restarted).
- Raise back button second press activation leniency in multiplayer based on back button press time setting <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This makes it easier to activate the HUD-provided back button when the setting is set to a high value.

# Bug Fixes

- Fix text input caret position not being in the expected position when an initial value is provided <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This effect can be seen in the multiplayer room creation dialog, where the caret position for room name is at the
    start instead of the end.
- Fix exported replay JSON erroneously overriding beatmap MD5 hash <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This caused exported replays to be unusable when importing them back to the game.
- Fix game potentially starting in a weird width/height setting <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Players who are affected by this bug may see the game starting at the left corner of their screen with a stretched
    aspect ratio.
- Fix input block area preventing input on the entire screen when an active input is in an area <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This meant that whenever a player touched an input block area, they would not be able to interact with anything else
    on the screen until they released the touch. They would see input drops whenever this happens.
- Fix cursor count limitation being affected by inputs in input block area <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - If the player has an input in an input block area, it would count towards the 3 cursor limit, meaning they would
    only be able to put 2 more fingers on the screen. They would see input drops whenever this happens.
- Fix cursor down state for remove slider lock setting not being updated when a press occurs <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This caused the setting to not work as expected.
